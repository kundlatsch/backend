**README**

This README explains some of the decision-making processes of the challange:

As this was my first experience with Ruby and RoR, I focused more on general aspects of the code rather than specific language-related or coding style issues.

**Dockerfile PR:** I submitted a PR for the Dockerfile because I found it helpful to use Docker for local execution of the project. Although it may not be directly related to the proposed challenge, I believed it would be a valuable addition.

**Improvements:** During the challenge, I aimed to complete it within the suggested time frame of 3 hours. Given more time, I would have focused on implementing JWT authorization to enhance security by eliminating the need to pass the user_id in each route. Additionally, I would have dedicated time to developing a more robust pagination system, including features such as customizable page size and returning the total number of pages to the user.
